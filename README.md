HoneyPot Used:
I attempted to use the Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP

Issues:
While this assignment was a great learning experience, it did not turn out as expected. After hours of troubleshooting, I could not get my Honeypot VM to work. As such, I was not able to collect data. I had got up to the part where we set have to set up Dionaea with HTTP. However, my admin VM would timeout when trying to get onto the site. I was able to access port 3000 on it to view the Honeymap, yet could not even get to the login page. I believe that if I was able to login, I would have been able to install the honeypot on my vm and then observe attacks on the admin console. The steps were very clear, however they were not much help in the case where certain steps/commands would not work. For example, my local VM ran out of space, one of the repositories was not found(got the link later myself/edited the .sh file). Then finally I had to redo the admin console set up several times, which was very time consuming.

Again, no data was collected, and therefore I have no questions.
